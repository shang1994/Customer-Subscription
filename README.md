# Customer-Subscription
To predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to an app ( 48 hours from the time they open the app)


The model created is intended to predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a platform based on multiple features. 

Goal

Given historical data on customers that viewed the platform and whether or not a customer subscribed to the platform,  we can build a model that can predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing and more importantly identify the nature of customers that do not sunscribe so that a company can come up with better marketing strategies to convert these non-subscribers.
